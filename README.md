IngotEngine
===========

IngotEngine is a clean-room implementation of a Minecraft 1.8 server. It does not depend on the Bukkit API (like Glowstone), and does not depend on decompiled Minecraft code (like Sponge). This gives IngotEngine a solid legal standing, unlike Bukkit, Glowstone, and Sponge which have been on legally shaky ground since their inception.

We love contributors! If you want to help IngotEngine get better, fork the project, add your changes, and we'll implement them as soon as possible! We're in the process of getting a Jenkins server up to allow for the first downloads
